# c plus

### Attention
1. The execution of all `C++` programs begins with the main function, regardless of where the function is actually located within the code.
2. Notice that the statement ends with a semicolon (;). This character marks the end of the statement, just as the period ends a sentence in English. All C++ statements must end with a semicolon character. One of the most common syntax errors in C++ is forgetting to end a statement with a semicolon.
